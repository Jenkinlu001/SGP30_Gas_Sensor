Introduction of sensor  
----------------------
The SGP30 is a digital multi-pixel gas sensor designed foreasy integration into air purifier,
demand-controlledventilation, and IoT applications. Sensirion’s CMOSens®technology offers a 
complete sensor system on a single chip featuring a digital I2C interface, a temperature 
controlled micro hotplate, and two preprocessed indoor air quality signals. As the first 
metal-oxide gas sensor featuring multiple sensing elements on one chip, the SGP30 provides 
more detailed information about the air quality.
